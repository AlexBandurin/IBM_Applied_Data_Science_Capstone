# Overview

Here, I will be predicting the landing success of Space X's Falcon 9 rocket using a machine learning classification algorithm, with a set of features that are the most relevant to predicting that outcome. 

Algorithms used: SVM, Classification Trees, Logistic Regression and KNN.

# Methodology

## Data collection:

I used an API and webscraping. It was stored in an IBM cloud database, DB2. From there, it was extracted using a series of SQL queries in Python. 

## EDA 

Exploratory data analysis performed using matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly packages. The latter was used to build an interactive dashboard which could also be very helpful for explaining the data as well as findings ML models to a potential stakeholder.
